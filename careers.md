# Careers

**We expect to be hiring for several full-time research and management roles from May to July. Salaries range from \\$60,000 for entry roles to \\$80,000 for senior roles.**

Why work with Epoch? 
- You can work from anywhere in the world, and work will primarily be done remotely We expect to organise group retreats every 6 months to do in-person coworking, and we can help with visa applications
- You get to work directly on topics that have key strategic importance
- Compared to other roles in AI safety, we do not require as much experience, and can offer a relatively easy ramp for getting into the field of AI governance/forecasting
- Going forward, we will work with prestigious organisations with which you will be affiliated, and release publications relating to our research agenda (more details in a followup hiring post)

You may be an especially good fit if you:
- Are knowledgeable about economics (particularly statistics and econometrics)
- Have experience with data science and programming (particularly scraping data)
- Are comfortable doing independent research
- Are familiar with forecasting, recent AI developments, technical AI safety, or AI governance. To get a feel for what kinds of background we think would be the most useful, see this shortform post. 

If you think you might be a good fit for us, please apply! If you’re unsure whether this is the right role for you, we strongly encourage you to apply anyway. Please register your interest for these roles at this airtable form – applications will open in May.
