      description: "We estimate an R&D-based growth model using: (1) data on machine learning performance using a monthly panel dataset on the top performance across 93 machine learning benchmarks, and (2) data on research input derived from data on academic publications. Using a co-integrated error correction approach, we estimate the average research elasticity of performance to be around .02% to .13% across three sub-fields of machine learning considered. Our estimates indicate modest positive inter-temporal knowledge spillovers, but stark diminishing returns to research effort (or large stepping-on-toes effects in the context of the knowledge production function). We illustrate the upshot of our results by computing the paths of average researcher productivity and find a sharp decline of between 4% and 26% per year. To further explain our results, we assess the contributions of different effects to the decline in research productivity by computing counterfactual growth paths. We find that while the decline in productivity is partially due to it becoming more difficult to improve on machine learning benchmarks for which performance is close to ideal, it is mostly due to other sources of diminishing returns to research effort."

    - name: Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning
      type: Paper
      domain: Machine Learning Trends
      date: "2022-02-11"

      description: "Compute, data, and algorithmic advances are the three fundamental factors that guide the progress of modern Machine Learning (ML). In this paper we study trends in the most readily quantified factor - compute. We show that before 2010 training compute grew in line with Moore’s law, doubling roughly every 20 months. Since the advent of Deep Learning in the early 2010s, the scaling of training compute has accelerated, doubling approximately every 6 months. In late 2015, a new trend emerged as firms developed large-scale ML models with 10 to 100-fold larger requirements in training compute. Based on these observations we split the history of compute in ML into three eras: the Pre Deep Learning Era, the Deep Learning Era and the Large-Scale Era. Overall, our work highlights the fast-growing compute requirements for training advanced ML systems."
