### We aim to gather crucial data about the inputs and outputs of Machine Learning systems, analyse trends, and build a big-picture of understanding of developments in AI. 

This involves:
- Designing guidelines for collecting relevant data, to help decision-makers monitor AI developments and make informed decisions
- Gathering data and making them publicly available for other researchers to build upon
- Creating measuring tools 
- Analysing data trends
