## Why Work with Epoch? 
- **You can work remotely from anywhere in the world**: We expect to organise group retreats every 6 months to do in-person coworking, and offer support with visa applications.
- **You can work on crucial problems that directly inform AI governance and strategy**.
- **We do not require degrees or extensive experience with AI or Economics**: Compared to other roles in AI safety, we offer a relatively easy ramp into the field of AI governance and forecasting.
- **You can gain valuable career experience**: Going forward, we will work with prestigious organisations with which you will be affiliated, and release publications relating to our research agenda.

## What We're Looking For
You may be an especially good fit for our team if:
- **You're knowledgeable about economics**, especially statistics and econometrics. We spend a lot of time analysing data and trends, in order to improve our understanding of AI developments.
- **You have experience with data science and programming**, and are comfortable gathering large amounts of data efficiently. 
- **You're comfortable doing independent research**, and are able to think critically. 
- **Are familiar with forecasting, recent AI developments, technical AI safety, or AI governance**.

Bear in mind that **you don't need to know about all of these things to be a strong candidate**. If you think you might be a good fit for us, please apply! If youâ€™re unsure whether this is the right role for you, we strongly encourage you to apply anyway.

*Applications will open in late May*.
