ML Models trained on more compute have better performance and more advanced capabilities (see e.g. Kaplan et al or ). Due to this, estimating and reporting compute usage is crucial to enable accurate comparisons between ML models.

Compute usage is commonly measured as the number of **floating point operations (FLOPs)** required to train the final version of the system. To estimate this we can resort to two strategies: a) using information about the architecture and amount of training data, or b) using information about the hardware used and training time.

Below we provide two calculators that illustrate these methods.
